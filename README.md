# NeoVim Plugin Notes

### Telescope

1. `<C-v>` opens in a new vertical split
2. `<C-t>` opens in a new tab

### vim-visual-multi

Basic usage:

- select words with Ctrl-N (like `Ctrl-d` in Sublime Text/VS Code)
- create cursors vertically with Ctrl-Down/Ctrl-Up
- select one character at a time with Shift-Arrows
- press n/N to get next/previous occurrence
- press [/] to select next/previous cursor
- press q to skip current and get next occurrence
- press Q to remove current cursor/selection
- start insert mode with i,a,I,A

Two main modes:

- in *cursor mode* commands work as they would in normal mode
- in *extend mode* commands work as they would in visual mode
- press Tab to switch between «cursor» and «extend» mode

Most vim commands work as expected (motions, r to replace characters, ~ to change case, etc). Additionally you can:

- run macros/ex/normal commands at cursors
- align cursors
- transpose selections
- add patterns with regex, or from visual mode

And more... of course, you can enter insert mode and autocomplete will work.
